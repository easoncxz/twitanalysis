It's not clear why there is this free-variable `page` in-scope.
It appears to be a special variable.

Relevant docs: Layouts
    https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/

`page.title` reaches in to each page's front-matter, kind of
"calling a hook".

`page.date` reads Jekyll-maintained metadata, as documented
in the reference doc above.
